    """Represents a UI string select menu with DI support.

    This is usually represented as a drop down menu.

    In order to get the selected items that the user has chosen, use :attr:`.values`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    .. versionchanged:: 2.7
        Renamed from ``Select`` to ``StringSelect``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    custom_id: :class:`str`
        The ID of the select menu that gets received during an interaction.
        If not given then one is generated for you.
    placeholder: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The placeholder text that is shown if nothing is selected, if any.
    min_values: :class:`int`
        The minimum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    max_values: :class:`int`
        The maximum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    disabled: :class:`bool`
        Whether the select is disabled.
    options: Union[List[:class:`disnake.SelectOption`], List[:class:`str`], Dict[:class:`str`, :class:`str`]]
        A list of options that can be selected in this menu. Use explicit :class:`.SelectOption`\\s
        for fine-grained control over the options. Alternatively, a list of strings will be treated
        as a list of labels, and a dict will be treated as a mapping of labels to values.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.5
            Now also accepts a list of str or a dict of str to str, which are then appropriately parsed as
            :class:`.SelectOption` labels and values.

    required: :class:`bool`
        Whether the select menu is required. Only applies to components in modals.
        Defaults to ``True``.

        .. versionadded:: 2.11
    id: :class:`int`
        The numeric identifier for the component. Must be unique within the message.
        If set to ``0`` (the default) when sending a component, the API will assign
        sequential identifiers to the components in the message.

        .. versionadded:: 2.11
    row: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The relative row this select menu belongs to. A Discord component can only have 5
        rows. By default, items are arranged automatically into those 5 rows. If you'd
        like to control the relative positioning of the row then passing an index is advised.
        For example, row=1 will show up before row=2. Defaults to ``None``, which is automatic
        ordering. The row number must be between 0 and 4 (i.e. zero indexed).

    Attributes
    ----------
    values: List[:class:`str`]
        A list of values that have been selected by the user.

    ----------
    cls: Callable[..., :class:`StringSelect`]
