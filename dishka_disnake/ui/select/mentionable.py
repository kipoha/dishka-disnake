    """Represents a UI mentionable (user/member/role) select menu.

    This is usually represented as a drop down menu.

    In order to get the selected items that the user has chosen, use :attr:`.values`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.7

    Parameters
    ----------
    custom_id: :class:`str`
        The ID of the select menu that gets received during an interaction.
        If not given then one is generated for you.
    placeholder: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The placeholder text that is shown if nothing is selected, if any.
    min_values: :class:`int`
        The minimum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    max_values: :class:`int`
        The maximum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    disabled: :class:`bool`
        Whether the select is disabled.
    default_values: Optional[Sequence[Union[:class:`~disnake.User`, :class:`.Member`, :class:`.Role`, :class:`.SelectDefaultValue`]]]
        The list of values (users/roles) that are selected by default.
        If set, the number of items must be within the bounds set by ``min_values`` and ``max_values``.

        Note that unlike other select menu types, this does not support :class:`.Object`\\s due to ambiguities.

        .. versionadded:: 2.10
    required: :class:`bool`
        Whether the select menu is required. Only applies to components in modals.
        Defaults to ``True``.

        .. versionadded:: 2.11
    id: :class:`int`
        The numeric identifier for the component. Must be unique within the message.
        If set to ``0`` (the default) when sending a component, the API will assign
        sequential identifiers to the components in the message.

        .. versionadded:: 2.11
    row: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The relative row this select menu belongs to. A Discord component can only have 5
        rows. By default, items are arranged automatically into those 5 rows. If you'd
        like to control the relative positioning of the row then passing an index is advised.
        For example, row=1 will show up before row=2. Defaults to ``None``, which is automatic
        ordering. The row number must be between 0 and 4 (i.e. zero indexed).

    Attributes
    ----------
    values: List[Union[:class:`~disnake.User`, :class:`.Member`, :class:`.Role`]]
        A list of users, members and/or roles that have been selected by the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls: Callable[..., :class:`MentionableSelect`]
        A callable (may be a :class:`MentionableSelect` subclass) to create a new instance of this component.

    custom_id: :class:`str`
        The ID of the select menu that gets received during an interaction.
        It is recommended not to set this parameter to prevent conflicts.
